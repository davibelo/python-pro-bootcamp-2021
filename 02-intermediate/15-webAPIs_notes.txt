API
    API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface
    which is a software intermediary that allows two applications 
    to talk to each other. 

    API is like a restaurant menu, that you can look and make your order

API Examples:
    Joke API
        https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/

API endpoint
    An API endpoint is a point at which an API connects with 
    the software program that is requesting the service.
    For example: An URL of a web service 

API Paths Parameters
    API paths parametersare defined in the global paths section 
    of the API specification. All paths are relative to the API server URL. 
    The full request URL is constructed as <server-url>/path parameter
    
    Paths parameters are used to get different services or information from 
    the respectively API

    Example:
        Joke API
            Endpoint: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke
            Paths: Programming, Dark
            URL: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming,Dark
                A get request on the result URL will get a joke in 
                Programming or Dark category

API Query Parameters
    Query Parameters are options you can pass with the endpoint 
    (such as specifying the response format or the amount returned) 
    to influence the response

    Example:
        Joke API
            Endpoint: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke
            Paths: Dark and Pun
            Parameter: format=txt and blacklistFlags=racist
                URL: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Dark,Pun?blacklistFlags=racist&format=txt
                    A get request on the result URL will get a joke in 
                    Dark or Pun category in a format of txt and not a racist joke

API authentication and other example of uses
    Open Weather API Documentation
        https://openweathermap.org/current
    You can create an account and get a auth key
        xxx
    API Call
        Model:
            api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
        Example: 
            api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid={API key}&q=Paris&units=metric

Formats of data used/returned by APIs
    JSON, XML, HTML...

JSON
    Java Script Object Notation
    Similar to an object in javascript
        It is like a python dictionary or nested dictionary

    To visualize better JSON on browsers, you can install 
    extensions on Chrome as JSON viewer Pro 
    
Useful application to test APIs 
    Instead of use address bar on a browser use postman desktop app

Web servers (and clients) works with HTTP protocol, see more at:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview

HTTP return codes 101
    1** hold on (wait)
    2** here you go (success)
    3** go away (security issues)
    4** you fucked up (client error)
    5** I fucked up (server error)

HTTP returns on wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
    Informational responses (100–199)
    Successful responses (200–299)
    Redirects (300–399)
    Client errors (400–499)
    Server errors (500–599)    

Authentication on Web APIs
    Necessary for majority of Web APIs
    For this, Web APIs uses API Keys

API Keys
    Normally, you register on web app provider
    and get an option to generate API Keys
