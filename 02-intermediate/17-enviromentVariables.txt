Environment Variables
    An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect 
    the way running processes will behave on a computer. 
    They are part of the environment in which a process runs

To see environment variables type "env" on console

To use environment variables on python
    Use dotenv module 
        Install on your enviroment with "pip install python-dotenv"
    Create a .env file with variables will want to load:
        VARIABLE1 = "string"
        VARIABLE2 = 10
    Call enviroment variables inside your main.py
        # importing required modules
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        import os
        
        # getting actual directory and making a rel path
        REL_PATH = f"{os.path.dirname(__file__)}/"

        # loading environment variables
        load_dotenv(dotenv_path=f"{REL_PATH}.env")

Protect .env file on gitignore:
    # environment files
    .env
