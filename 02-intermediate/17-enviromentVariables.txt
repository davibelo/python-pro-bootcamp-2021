Environment Variables
    An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect 
    the way running processes will behave on a computer. 
    They are part of the environment in which a process runs

To see linux environment variables type "env" on console
To add environment varible on linux type:
    $ export VARIABLE=VALUE
    or edit /usr/bin/env

You does not need to use system environment variables.
Use .env files instead

To use environment variables on python
    Install dotenv module on your project
        Install on your enviroment with "pip install python-dotenv"
    Create a .env file with variables will want to load:
        VARIABLE1 = "string"
        VARIABLE2 = 10
    Call .env variables inside your main.py:
        # importing required modules
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        import os
        
        # getting actual directory and making a rel path
        REL_PATH = f"{os.path.dirname(__file__)}/"

        # loading environment variables
        load_dotenv(dotenv_path=f"{REL_PATH}.env")

Protect .env file on gitignore:
    # environment files
    .env
