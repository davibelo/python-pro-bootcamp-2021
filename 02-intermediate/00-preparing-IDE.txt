    It is a tool that help to write, test, debug and run code.

Linter
    lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool 
    used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors,

            view the structure of your code
            refactor rename (refactor feature on right click)
            and much more...
    3. Create a new project
            Choose last python interpreter
            Choose virtual environment            
            Create a main.py
    4. Start to code
        Use this features:
            Press Shift+F10 to execute it or replace it with your code.
            Press Double Shift to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings.

To use Visual Code instead of PyCharm:
    1. Install python
        Windows:  
            Download installer on https://www.python.org/
            Install python to PATH
        Linux:

            $ sudo apt install python3-distutils
            $ sudo apt install python3-pip
    2. Install Visual Code
    3. Install Python and Jupyter extensions      
    4. Install virtual environments package
        $ sudo apt install python3-venv
    5. Create a virtual environment on your project folder named .venv
        $ python3 -m venv .venv
        OBS: To remove a virtual environment, just delete the .venv folder
        After creating or deleting, reboot VS Code
    6. Go to code command line and type:
        > Python: Select Interpreter
        and select your recently created environment
    7. Remember to add .venv on .gitignore (.venv/**)
    8. Set code formatter 
        Choose autopep8
        Don't choose black
    9. Set code linter
        Enable pylama or flask8
        Disable others: bandit, mypy, etc

Using keyboard shortcuts to run parts of the code on VS Code
    Select the lines you want to execute
    Press Shift+Enter
    It will open a python terminal and run the selected code
    You can continue to select other lines and run them
